# 3D-Data-visualization
## What it does
Its 3D Data Visualization.3D Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

## How we built it
I build with python and use numpy, pandas, matplotlib libray.

## Challenges we ran into
In this Project we have some about surface so I use this data and create 3D surface graph. Its provide an 
accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
I learnt how  to use matplotlib , numpy , pandas and data visualization in python.
